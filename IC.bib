	abstract = {We investigate the labor market impacts of internal migration in Brazil using a shift-share approach which combines weather-induced migration with past settlement patterns in each destination. Increasing internal migration rate by 1ùëù.ùëù. reduces formal employment of natives by 0.30ùëù.ùëù., while increases the share of informal jobs by 0.15ùëù.ùëù. and self-employment by 0.10ùëù.ùëù. Consistent with downward wage rigidity in the formal sector, we Ô¨Ånd no effect on formal earnings but a negative impact on the share of workers receiving nonwage beneÔ¨Åts. Informal and self-employment earnings decrease by 1.4 ‚àí 1.5\%. Less educated individuals bear most of the losses due to migration.},

	abstract = {The immediate physical damages caused by environmental disasters are conspicuous and often the focus of media and government attention. In contrast, the nature and magnitude of post-disaster losses remain largely unknown because they are not easily observable. Here we exploit annual variation in the incidence of typhoons (West-PaciÔ¨Åc hurricanes) to identify post-disaster losses within Filipino households. We Ô¨Ånd that unearned income and excess infant mortality in the year after typhoon exposure outnumber immediate damages and death tolls roughly 15-to-1. Typhoons destroy durable assets and depress incomes, leading to broad expenditure reductions achieved in part through disinvestments in health and human capital. Infant mortality mirrors these economic responses, and additional Ô¨Åndings ‚Äì that only female infants are at risk, that sibling competition elevates risk, and that infants conceived after a typhoon are also at risk ‚Äì indicate that this excess mortality results from household decisions made while coping with post-disaster economic conditions. We estimate that these posttyphoon ‚Äúeconomic deaths‚Äù constitute 13\% of the overall infant mortality rate in the Philippines. Taken together, these results indicate that economic and human losses due to environmental disaster may be an order of magnitude larger than previously thought and that adaptive decision-making may amplify, rather than dampen, disasters‚Äô social cost.

These databases were addressed using two basic methodological procedures: descriptive analysis of systematic information and comparative analysis, by means of the construction of tables that helped to analyze the information selected. The comparison revealed that with the current databases it is not possible to affirm if disasters and mortality due to disasters are increasing in Brazil, since there are variations in the intensity of the events that occur each year. The information available shows the importance of the mega disaster that occurred in the mountainous region of Rio de Janeiro in 2011, especially in the municipality of Nova Friburgo. In this case the disaster affected the various age groups in both sexes in different ways: the 5 to 9-year-old age group was the most affected among men and women, as well as the 20 to 24-year-old age group (for women) and the 30 to 34-year-old age group (for men).},

These findings inform debates over climate's role in economic development and suggest the possibility of substantial negative impacts of higher temperatures on poor countries.

These studies focus on changes in weather realizations over time within a given spatial area and demonstrate impacts on agricultural output, industrial output, labor productivity, energy demand, health, conflict, and economic growth, among other outcomes. By harnessing exogenous variation over time within a given spatial unit, these studies help credibly identify (i) the breadth of channels linking weather and the economy, (ii) heterogeneous treatment effects across different types of locations, and (iii) nonlinear effects of weather variables. This paper reviews the new literature with two purposes. First, we summarize recent work, providing a guide to its methodologies, datasets, and findings.

In particular, we introduce two novel sensitivity measures suited for routine reporting.The robustness value describes the minimum strength of association that unobserved confounding would need to have, both with the treatment and with the outcome, to change the research conclusions. The partial R2 of the treatment with the outcome shows how strongly confounders explaining all the residual outcome variation would have to be associated with the treatment to eliminate the estimated effect. Next, we offer graphical tools for elaborating on problematic confounders, examining the sensitivity of point estimates and t-values, as well as ‚Äòextreme scenarios‚Äô. Finally, we describe problems with a common ‚Äòbenchmarking‚Äô practice and introduce a novel procedure to bound the strength of confounders formally on the basis of a comparison with observed covariates. We apply these methods to a running example that estimates the effect of exposure to violence on attitudes toward peace.},

In contrast to alternative DID estimators, the proposed estimators are consistent if either (but not necessarily both) a propensity score or outcome regression working models are correctly specified. We also derive the semiparametric efficiency bound for the ATT in DID designs when either panel or repeated cross-section data are available, and show that our proposed estimators attain the semiparametric efficiency bound when the working models are correctly specified. Furthermore, we quantify the potential efficiency gains of having access to panel data instead of repeated cross-section data. Finally, by paying particular attention to the estimation method used to estimate the nuisance parameters, we show that one can sometimes construct doubly robust DID estimators for the ATT that are also doubly robust for inference. Simulation studies and an empirical application illustrate the desirable finite-sample performance of the proposed estimators. Open-source software for implementing the proposed policy evaluation tools is available.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14497},
	abstract = {Heterogeneous effect estimation plays a crucial role in causal inference, with applications across medicine and social science. Many methods for estimating conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) have been proposed in recent years, but there are important theoretical gaps in understanding if and when such methods are optimal. This is especially true when the CATE has nontrivial structure (e.g., smoothness or sparsity). Our work contributes in several main ways. First, we study a two-stage doubly robust CATE estimator and give a generic model-free error bound, which, despite its generality, yields sharper results than those in the current literature. We apply the bound to derive error rates in nonparametric models with smoothness or sparsity, and give sufficient conditions for oracle efficiency. Underlying our error bound is a general oracle inequality for regression with estimated or imputed outcomes, which is of independent interest; this is the second main contribution. The third contribution is aimed at understanding the fundamental statistical limits of CATE estimation. To that end, we propose and study a local polynomial adaptation of double-residual regression. We show that this estimator can be oracle efficient under even weaker conditions, if used with a specialized form of sample splitting and careful choices of tuning parameters. These are the weakest conditions currently found in the literature, and we conjecture that they are minimal in a minimax sense. We go on to give error bounds in the non-trivial regime where oracle rates cannot be achieved. Some finite-sample properties are explored with simulations.},
